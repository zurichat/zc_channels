.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html

Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd channel_plugin
    celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.

Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog
