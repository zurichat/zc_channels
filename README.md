## **Project Description**

The Channel Plugin is a feature that helps users create spaces for conversation
and communication on zuri.chat.
Users can also create sub tags in the channels option where other things can be
done, ranging from game nights, football banter, random, announcement and
so much more.
This adds the feature of having organized conversations in dedicated spaces called channels.

**_Benefits of Channels :_**

- Channels bring order and clarity to work â€” you can create them for any project, topic, or team
- They provide an organised, focused and centeral space for members to have conversations, share files and information.
- Increased access to shared knowledge across your workspace.
- Public channels to promote transparency and inclusivity.
- Private channels are for conversations that should not be open to all members.
